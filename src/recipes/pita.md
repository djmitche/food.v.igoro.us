This recipe is from [Rose Levy Berenbaum's Bread Bible](rose-levy-berenbaum-s-bread-bi.html).  It's really easy, and makes a great breakfast.

# Ingredients

* 454g all-purpose flour
* 295g water
* 2 t salt
* 2 t yeast
* 2 T olive oil

# Instructions

 1. Combine all ingredients, kneading for about 10 minutes.  Scrape down the dough a minute or two into the kneading.  The dough should clean the bowl.
 1. Refrigerate the dough overnight
 1. Divide into 8 pieces; roll each into a disk about 1/4" thick, and allow to rest for 20m
 1. Preheat a griddle on a medium flame; there's no need for any fat
 1. Place a disk on the griddle; turn after 1 minute, and again after 3 minutes or when the underside begins to brown.  The idea with the quick flipping is to quickly bake the outside of the dough on both sides, locking more steam on the inside to bake and inflate the bread.  As large bubbles start to form, lightly tapping the pita with a finger can help break bonds that are preventing the bubbles from spreading.

# Notes

I usually divide the dough into pieces, pop them in little 1/2 cup tupperwares, and toss them in the freezer. Every evening I put one of those containers in the fridge to thaw, then roll it out in the morning before my shower.  After the shower, I fire up a burner, throw the pita on, and head off to work with a nice warm snack.

Thanks to Amber Pawula for recommending this particular process!
