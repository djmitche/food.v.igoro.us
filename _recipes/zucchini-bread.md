This recipe seems way too complicated to me, and anyway came out with a distinct tinny flavor from the soda.
It makes one 4x8" pan (divided in half, hence the egg-and-a-half)

 * 1.5 eggs (I've tried with 2..)
 * &frac12; C vegetable oil
 * 1 C white sugar
 * 1&frac12; T vanilla extract
 * 1 C grated zucchini

# Instructions
