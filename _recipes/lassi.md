This Indian yogurt drink is awesome.  Salty sounds like it wouldn't taste good, but try it!

# Ingredients

* 2 parts milk
* 4 parts [|yogurt](yogurt.html)
* 1 part sugar, or less

# Instructions

Mix.

Lassis usually come in salty, sweet, and mango flavors.  Just add some of the relevant ingredient.  I use SWAD mango pulp for mango lassis.
