This recipe makes a whole wheat loaf that comes out just like you'd expect -- the texture is a bit coarse and the flavor is wheaty, with some sweetness.  While it began its life in Gelles' 1000 Vegetarian Recipes, I've modified it (using advice from Alton Brown) to use a sponge.


# Ingredients

 *  Sponge
   *  260g warm water
   *  1/2t sugar
   *  2.5t yeast
   *  160g whole wheat flour
   *  80g all-purpose flour
 *  Dough
   *  160g whole wheat flour
   *  80g all-purpose flour
   *  2t salt
   *  4T honey
   *  2T vegetable oil

# Instructions

 1.  Proof the yeast with the water in the bowl of the stand mixer.
 1.  Add the rest of the sponge ingredients and mix with a fork.
 1.  Sift together the dry dough ingredients and pour them over the sponge, but do not combine.
 1.  Allow the sponge to develop for some number of hours.  I waited about 8 hours.  It may bubble up through the dry mixture -- this is fine.
 1.  Add the honey and vegetable oil and begin kneading the dough on #2.
 1.  As the dough pulls together, raise the speed to #4 and knead until the dough is firm and only barely tacky.
 1.  Rise until doubled -- 1-2h.
 1.  Fold down and shape the dough into a loaf.  Rise about 30 minutes.
 1.  Bake at 350 for about 45m or until the loaf is browned.  Rotate midway through the baking.
