This recipe is from Sibel Kazak.


# Ingredients

 *  2 eggs (the yolk of one of them is to brush on the biscuits when you put them on a tray)
 *  1/4 C yogurt
 *  1/4 C oil (I used sunflower oil)
 *  200 g butter (melted) (by my measure, this is about 18 T)
 *  1 teaspoon salt
 *  1 T baking powder
 *  3.5 C flour

# Instructions

Mix everything except flour and baking powder. Then add flour and baking 
powder and mix all. Rest the dough for 10 min. Then place the small pieces 
(make them like a ball) on a cookie sheet and brush the egg yolk on top of 
each. Bake it in a preheated oven at 400 F for about 20-30 min.

Bon appetit! (Afiyet olsun - in Turkish)

# Notes

This recipe really needs all that butter, frighteningly enough!  The resulting biscuits are extraordinarily tender, with a dry exterior and a moist interior.  As you'll guess from the ingredients, there's not much flavor.  The texture is granular, probably fitting well with a brothy soup or perhaps some steamed veggies.
