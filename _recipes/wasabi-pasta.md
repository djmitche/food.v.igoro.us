This isn't very complex, but it's really good and kinda unusual.


# Ingredients

 *  Pasta (any sort)
 *  Wasabi Mayonnaise (not just wasabi; this comes in a bottle and is white with green flecks)


# Instructions

 1.  Prepare pasta
 1.  Squirt about 1.5T of mayo per serving, stir, and eat

This is also great with some veggieburger (or presumably burger) mixed in.
