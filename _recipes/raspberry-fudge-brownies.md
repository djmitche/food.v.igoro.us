title: Raspberry Fudge Brownies

---

These are the best brownies ever to occur on the planet, if I do say so myself.
The raspberry jam keeps the brownies moist and adds nice depth to the very intense chocolate
This is an amalgamation of triple-chocolate fudge brownies from epicurious.com and some killer raspberry brownies that my friend Richard used to make

# Ingredients

 * 6 ounces fine-quality bittersweet chocolate chopped
 * 2 ounces unsweetened chocolate chopped
 * 1.5 sticks (3/4 cup) unsalted butter
 * 1.5 cups sugar
 * 2 teaspoons vanilla
 * 4 large eggs
 * 1 teaspoon salt
 * 1 cup all-purpose flour
 * 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
 * roughly 1/2 c seedless raspberry jam
 * 1/2 c chopped walnuts (optional)

# Instructions

 1. Melt first 3 ingredients together in double-boiler over very very low heat, stirring constantly 
 1. Stir in the sugar and the vanilla and add the eggs 1 at a time 
 1. Combine salt and flour then add to chocolate mixture stirring until just combined 
 1. Stir in the chocolate chips 
 1. Pour the batter into a well-buttered and floured 13- by 9-inch baking pan 
 1. Drop teaspoonfulls of jam randomly over the top of the batter - I do not measure very carefully 
 1. Take a fork and swirl the jam into the brownies 
 1. Top with walnuts if you like 
 1. Bake in the middle of a preheated 350 degree oven for 25 to 30 minutes or until a tester comes out with crumbs adhering to it 
 1. Let the mixture cool completely in the pan on a rack and cut it into 24 bars

# Notes

Regarding the chocolate for the bittersweet chocolate, I use whatever dark chocolate bar (60% cocoa) I have on hand for eating such as Green and Black, Black's, or Scharffenberger.
High-quality chocolate makes a big difference but it is expensive and certainly baker's chocolate would turn out just fine -- use whatever you have.
Sometimes I think that the chocolate chips are overkill; one day I might try this without them

Regarding the double-boiler, if you don't have one just nest a metal bowl over a small saucepan containing 1" of gently simmering water

Regarding cooking time: I start checking for doneness after 15 minutes.
I like very dense fudgy brownies so I err on the undercooked side -- about 20 minutes.
Letting them cook longer will create more cakey brownies that might be in danger of drying out though the raspberry jam should theoretically help prevent that

Regarding the jam and nuts: jam can be omitted but I think it it's what makes this recipe truly divine instead of merely good.
I really enjoy putting nuts on top before baking; they get all crisp and toasty in the oven some people (lunatics) do not like nuts in brownies so I usually only sprinkle them on half.
