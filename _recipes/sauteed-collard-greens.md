title: Sauteed Collard Greens

This recipe is from the incredible Dr. Webster, a former teacher at my school.  Well, it's an oral tradition, meaning any errors or omissions are my fault.

I cooked this on a camping trip with extremely variable heat.  It was accompanied by a potato hash and [cornbread](corn-muffins.html).  Apparently it's hard to screw up.


# Ingredients

 *  Collard Greens (2 or more bunches)
 *  Mustard Greens
 *  Other green stuff, as desired
 *  Onions
 *  A coupla cloves garlic
 *  Juice of a lemon
 *  Two glugs olive oil
 *  Salt and pepper


# Instructions

 1. Stem the greens and chop them into thin strips.  I found it easiest to cut each side of the leaf off the stem, then collect these half-leaves into stacks of 5 or so.  I rolled each stack up, then sliced through the roll, producing nice thin strips.
 1. Start sauteeing the garlic in a hot pan with the oil, just until you see some action.
 1. Add the onions and some salt to get them sweating.  Stir until they begin to soften.
 1. Add some greens, some more salt, and the lemon juice.  Stir until the greens have cooked down enough to add another batch.
 1. Keep going until all of your greens are in, then cook down to a nice, soft consistency.
 1. Add salt and pepper to taste.
