This recipe was the result of a quick Google search, and is [here](http://www.24hourfitness.com/html/nutrition/recipes/appetizer/finger/veg_dumplings/) as of this writing.  The below is a local copy, just in case that moves, with my own modifications.  In particular, steaming didn't work at all, so this recipe calls for frying.


# Ingredients


## Potstickers

 *  6 shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and sliced
 *  3 C green cabbage, finely chopped
 *  1 C purple cabbage, finely chopped
 *  1 large carrot, shredded

 1.  Heat a pan over medium-high heat with the oil. Add mushrooms, ginger, and garlic and stir until mushrooms begin to soften.
