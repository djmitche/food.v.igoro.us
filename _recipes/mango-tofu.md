title: Mango Tofu

I made this one up, so it can certainly use some improvement.  It's not terribly sweet, but has a great pumpkiny flavor.  I'm thinking this might make a good dessert over biscuits (like peach cobbler).  It might also go really well with rice!

* 1 orange, large dice
* 1 T butter

* 1/2 t nutmeg
