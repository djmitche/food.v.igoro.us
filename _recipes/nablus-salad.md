ingredient: [Nablus Cheese]
meal: [Salad]
title: Nablus Salad

---
I found Nablus cheese at North Water Market on Devon.  I had no idea what it tasted like, but I figured it would be good in a salad.  It's somewhere between mozarella and feta: it has the smooth texture of mozarella, but some of the salty flavor of feta.  Its salt provides a nice counterpoint to the sweetness of the grapes.
# Ingredients

* Lettuce -- something sweet, like red or boston, sliced thinly
* Grapes, halved
* Nablus cheese, loosely diced
* Pine nuts, lightly toasted
* Tasty olive oil
* Pepper
(sorry -- no quantities.  I have a hard enough time following quantities, let alone inventing them!)

# Instructions

 1. mix the ingredients
 1. drizzle olive oil
 1. add pepper to taste
