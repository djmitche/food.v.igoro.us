title: Braised Haddock
---

This is from the March/April 2015 issue of Cook's Illustrated.
It makes a nice flaky result, along with a good sauteed veggie base to put the fish on.
The original calls for halibut, but haddock works great, too.

# Ingredients

 * four 6- to 8-ounce fish fillets - try to get a consistent thickness, and fairly thick
 * 6 tbsp butter
 * 1 lb leeks, halved and sliced thin, white and light green bits only
 * 1 tsp Dijon mustard
 * &frac34; C dry white wine
 * 1 tsp lemon juice

# Instructions

 1. Sprinkle fish with salt.
    Melt butter in a skillet large enough to hold all of the fish fillets in a single layer.
    Add the fish, *skin side up*, and set the heat to medium.
    Cook until the butter burns, shifting the fish occasionally to prevent sticking.
 1. Remove the fish to a temporary plate, flipping it skin-side-down as you go.
 1. Add leeks, mustard, and a pinch of salt to the skillet and cook until the veggies start to soften
 1. Add the wine and bring to a simmer.
    Return the fish to the pan, *skin side down*.
    Cover and cook at a gentle simmer until the fish's internal temperature reaches 135&deg;F.
 1. Transfer the fish to a serving platter, then tranfer the veggies, arranging the veggies under the fish, and draining as much liquid as possible into the pan.
 1. Bring the remaining liquid to a simmer and hold it until thickended.
    Once thickened, add some lemon juice and salt and pepper, and spoon over the fish.

# Variations

## Fennel and Figs

Replace the leeks with two fennel bulbs, cored and sliced thin.
Replace the mustard with four dried figs, chopped.
Replace the wine with Japanese white wine vinegar.
