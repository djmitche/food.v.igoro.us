# Remarks

Beets are sooooo good.  mmmmmmm.  Cippoline onions are sweet.


# Ingredients

 * Some quantity of beets
 * Some pearl or cippoline onions, roughly 1 per 3 beets but however many you want
 * garlic cloves (optional)
 * olive oil (optional)


# Instructions

Wash beets and trim the leaves, leaving ~1 inch of stem.  Leave the tails intact to keep all the juices inside.  Blanch the onions in boiling water for 1 min, immerse in cold water, and slip off the skins.  Pile beets and onions on large squares of aluminum foil.  If desired, place a garlic clove, unpeeled, with one tip cut off in the center of the pile.  Drizzle with olive oil and seal the pouch by pressing the edges of the foil together and folding them over, then folding the ends over.  Bake as you would a potato, 350-400 deg for 45-60 min.  Peel the beets and serve with butter, salt and pepper.   It's also nice to steam or stir-fry the beet greens and make a warm or cold salad with the beets.
