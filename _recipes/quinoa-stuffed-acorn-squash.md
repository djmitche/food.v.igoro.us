I have a hard time liking squash, for some reason.  But this recipe adds some other interesting flavors.  It's from Irma S. Rombauer's Joy of Cooking.


# Ingredients

 *  3 acorn squash
 *  1 T butter
 *  0.5 C chopped onions
 *  0.5 C quinoa, rinsed and drained
 *  1 C stock
 *  salt, pepper
 *  0.25 C chopped nuts (Irma recommends hazelnuts or toasted almonds; I used walnuts)
 *  2 T fresh parsely
 *  4 T parmesan cheese


# Instructions

 1.  Bake halved acorn squash cut-down in a pan of water at 350 degrees for about 45 minutes, until soft.  Allow to cool (but leave the oven on).
 1.  Sautee the onions briefly in the butter, then add the quinoa and stir until slightly toasted.
 1.  Add the stock, boil, and simmer for 15 minutes.
 1.  Scoop out the meat of two halves of squash.
 1.  Season remaining squash with salt and pepper.
 1.  Combine quinoa and squash with nuts, parsely, and half of the cheese.
 1.  Spoon mixture into squash halves, sprinkle remaining cheese on top, and bake until heated through (about 20m).
