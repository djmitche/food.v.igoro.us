title: Banana Bread

---
This is my go-to recipe whenever I don't manage to eat my bananas.  It works with bananas from the time they get brown spots until they're totally brown.  Once they're brown and shriveled, well, it's too late.  Like most of my go-to recipes, this one is from [Irma S. Rombauer's Joy of Cooking](irma-s--rombauer-s-joy-of-cook.html).  I've left out the nuts, because I don't like them.

# Ingredients

* 1.33  C all-purpose flour
* 0.75 t salt
* 0.5 t baking soda
* 0.25 t baking powder
* 5 T butter
* 0.66 C sugar
* 2 eggs, beaten
* 1 banana, chopped up

# Instructions

 1. Cream the butter and sugar together.
 1. Whisk the flour, salt, baking soda, and baking powder to mix, and add to the creamed butter and sugar.
 1. Beat in the eggs.
 1. Fold in the banana.
 1. Bake in loaf pans at 350 for 50-60 minutes or until a tester comes out clean.

# Notes

I like a little saltiness in my banana bread, so I always use coarse sea salt in this recipe.  The result is little gems of salt in the final loaf.
