title: Chocolate Chip Cookies

---
Once again, go to the source for the best recipe.  This one is from [Irma S. Rombauer's Joy of Cooking](irma-s--rombauer-s-joy-of-cook.html), and it's my favorite.  I happen to be a fan of cookies that spread out to become thin and crisp, with ample chocolate chips.  I don't like nuts, so I've left them out.
