title: Peanut-Kaffir Lime Sauce

---
This is part of [Chiang Mai Tofu Grill](chiang-mai-tofu-grill.html) from [Rebar Modern Food Cookbook](rebar-modern-food-cookbook.html).  It's really good on its own, though, and would probably fit well on wide noodles, with broccoli, etc.

This is a really strong sauce, which improves with age.

# Ingredients

* 0.5 can coconut milk (careful!  This stuff '''will''' knock you out)
* 6 kaffir lime leaves (these are available at thai markets)
* 2 T minced ginger
* 1/3 C smooth peanut butter
* 1 t soy sauce
* 1/8 t red curry paste
* 0.5 oz palm sugar (or brown sugar)
* 2 t lime juice
* 0.25 t salt
* 0.25 t sriracha
* 2 T hot water
# Instructions

* heat coconut milk, lime, and ginger over low heat
* remove from heat and allow to cool for 1 hour
* re-heat and combine remaining ingredients
* simmer, season, and thin if necessary
# Notes

I made this recipe and used it immediately, and was overwhelmed by the the coconut milk.  I refrigerated it (it solidified) and then reheated it the next day, and the flavors are perfectly balanced.  Word to the wise.
