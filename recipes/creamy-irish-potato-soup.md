title: Creamy Irish Potato Soup

---
This is adapted from [this site](http://shenanchie.tripod.com/weblog/mar05.htm#IrishinKitchen)
# Ingredients

* 2 T butter 
* 4 green onions 
* 1 stalk celery 
* 1 C veggie Broth 
* 1 bottle Guinness
* 2 medium potatoes, sliced 
* 1.5 C sharp cheddar, shredded
* 2 C milk

# Instructions

 1. Sautee the onions and celery in the butter until tender. 
 1. Add broth, pepper, Guinness and potatoes; boil and simmer until potatoes are tender.  Add more liquid if necessary.
 1. Blend with the cheese and milk -- this should be done in parts with a stand blender.

# Notes

I made this one up as I went along the first time, and ended up with way too much potato.  Of the three balanced flavors here -- beer, potato, and cheese -- the first two can occur in basically any ratio, and complement each other well.  Just be conservative with the cheese, lest the soup end up tasting like liquid cheddar.
