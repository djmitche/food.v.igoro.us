I have a hard time liking squash, for some reason.  But this recipe adds some other interesting flavors.  It's from Irma S. Rombauer's Joy of Cooking.

=Ingredients=
* 3 acorn squash
* 1 T butter
* 0.5 C chopped onions
* 0.5 C quinoa, rinsed and drained
* 1 C stock
* salt, pepper
* 0.25 C chopped nuts (Irma recommends hazelnuts or toasted almonds; I used walnuts)
* 2 T fresh parsely
* 4 T parmesan cheese

=Instructions=
# Bake halved acorn squash cut-down in a pan of water at 350 degrees for about 45 minutes, until soft.  Allow to cool (but leave the oven on).
# Sautee the onions briefly in the butter, then add the quinoa and stir until slightly toasted.
# Add the stock, boil, and simmer for 15 minutes.
# Scoop out the meat of two halves of squash.
# Season remaining squash with salt and pepper.
# Combine quinoa and squash with nuts, parsely, and half of the cheese.
# Spoon mixture into squash halves, sprinkle remaining cheese on top, and bake until heated through (about 20m).
