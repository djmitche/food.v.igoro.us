__NOTOC__
Here's the math: Rose's bagel recipe calls for a yeast : water : flour ratio of .47% : 39% : 61%; that's a little more yeast, but the same liquid : soild ratio as her basic white bread (which is .45% : 38% : 61%).  They're basically the same recipe, with two differences: the bagels have more yeast, and the bread uses all-purpose flour, while the bagels call for bread flour; thus the bagels are a white bread with additional protein.

Now the challenge is to adapt Rose's potato buttermilk recipe to bagel standards.  The potato buttermilk bread's ratio is .39% : 41% : 58% -- a good bit wetter.  She compensates for this with the use of bread flour and vital wheat gluten, producing a bread with approximately the same crumb as her basic white bread.  

So to make this a bagel recipe, I'll start with the potato buttermilk recipe, add 1-2% more vital wheat gluten, double the recipe (just for volume), up the yeast, and make my usual substitution of yogurt for buttermilk.

=To Do=
* These came out a bit burned and overboiled (they have that waterlogged feel to them).  I'm thinking that the boiling basically needs to be a quick scalding?
* The last time I made these, they weren't burned or overboiled, but the bread structure doesn't survive the boiling very well -- they end up wrinkled and flat.  I think they need a lot more kneading (so they don't get so fragile after their shaping rise) and something to give them some additional ovenspring (perhaps more water?) I also just moved most of the ingredients into the biga for a more flavorful experience.
=Ingredients=
==Biga==
* 3 t yeast
* 368g water (or more? see above)
* 400g KA bread flour
==Dough==
*318g KA bread flour
*122g potato flour
*2 t vital wheat gluten
*2 T sugar
*242g yogurt (or scalded milk)
*4 t salt

=Instructions=
#Make the biga, cover with dry ingredients, and set aside for six hours.
#Mix dry dough ingredients with biga on low speed; add yogurt until moistened.
#Allow to rest 20m.
#Mix on #4 for 7-10 minutes, until dough becomes very elastic and jumps back when poked.
#Rise until doubled, 1-2h.
#Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and preheat the oven broiler.
#Shape and rise for 15m.
#Boil quickly on each side; underrisen bagels may sink; results should be wrinkly
#Broil for 1 minute on each side.
#Bake at 450 for 25 minutes or until nicely browned.
