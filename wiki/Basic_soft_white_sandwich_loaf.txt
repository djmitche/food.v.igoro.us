Another recipe from Rose Levy Berenbaum's Bread Bible, this one is a nice, easy sandwich loaf.

=Ingredients=
* Starter
** 341g regular flour
** 405g water
** 45g (2 T+) honey
** 3/4 t yeast
* Dough
** 311g regular flour
** 40g dry milk
** 3/4 t yeast
** 9 T unsalted butter
** 2 t salt

=Instructions=
# Mix the sponge vigorously (to incorporate air) (in the kitchenaid bowl if you have one)
# Mix the flour, dry milk, and yeast the dough and sprinkle over the sponge
# Allow the sponge to rise for 1-4 hours; it will bubble through the flour blanket
# Add the softened, chopped butter.
# Mix the dough on #2 just long enough to bring it together, then let it rest for 20 minutes
# Add the salt and mix on #4 for 7-10m or until it comes away from the bowl.
# Rise the dough until doubled (1.5-2h), give it two business letter folds, and rise it again (1-2h).
# Shape and pan the dough and rise it for 1.5-2h
# Bake at 350 for 50m, adding steam at the beginning of the baking.
