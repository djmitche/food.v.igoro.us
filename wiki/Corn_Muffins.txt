The last two times I've made this, it's come out soggy in the middle.  Perhaps the time needs to be upped?  This is only for thicker loaves or muffins.

Also, I put in 8T butter by mistake.  The bread came out a bit greasier than usual, but with a great helping of butter flavor.  The butter level can probably be adjusted to accomodate the greasiness of the other food involved.
