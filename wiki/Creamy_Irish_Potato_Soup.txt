=Ingredients=
* 2 T butter 
* 4 green onions 
* 1 stalk celery 
* 1 C veggie Broth 
* 1 bottle Guinness
* 2 medium potatoes, sliced 
* 1.5 C sharp cheddar, shredded
* 2 C milk

=Instructions=
# Sautee the onions and celery in the butter until tender. 
# Add broth, pepper, Guinness and potatoes; boil and simmer until potatoes are tender.  Add more liquid if necessary.
# Blend with the cheese and milk -- this should be done in parts with a stand blender.

=Notes=
I made this one up as I went along the first time, and ended up with way too much potato.  Of the three balanced flavors here -- beer, potato, and cheese -- the first two can occur in basically any ratio, and complement each other well.  Just be conservative with the cheese, lest the soup end up tasting like liquid cheddar.
