This recipe is from the incredible Dr. Webster, a former teacher at my school.  Well, it's an oral tradition, meaning any errors or omissions are my fault.

I cooked this on a camping trip with extremely variable heat.  It was accompanied by a potato hash and [[Recipe:Cornbread|cornbread]].  Apparently it's hard to screw up.

=Ingredients=
* Collard Greens (2 or more bunches)
* Mustard Greens
* Other green stuff, as desired
* Onions
* A coupla cloves garlic
* Juice of a lemon
* Two glugs olive oil
* Salt and pepper

=Instructions=
#Stem the greens and chop them into thin strips.  I found it easiest to cut each side of the leaf off the stem, then collect these half-leaves into stacks of 5 or so.  I rolled each stack up, then sliced through the roll, producing nice thin strips.
#Start sauteeing the garlic in a hot pan with the oil, just until you see some action.
#Add the onions and some salt to get them sweating.  Stir until they begin to soften.
#Add some greens, some more salt, and the lemon juice.  Stir until the greens have cooked down enough to add another batch.
#Keep going until all of your greens are in, then cook down to a nice, soft consistency.
#Add salt and pepper to taste.
