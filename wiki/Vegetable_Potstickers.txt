This recipe was the result of a quick Google search, and is [http://www.24hourfitness.com/html/nutrition/recipes/appetizer/finger/veg_dumplings/ here] as of this writing.  The below is a local copy, just in case that moves, with my own modifications.  In particular, steaming didn't work at all, so this recipe calls for frying.

=Ingredients=
==Potstickers==
* 6 shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and sliced
* 3 C green cabbage, finely chopped
* 1 C purple cabbage, finely chopped
* 1 large carrot, shredded
* 4 medium green onions, chopped
* 1 t grated gingerroot
* 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
* 2 T soy sauce
* 1 T sesame oil
* 30 wonton wrappers

==Sauce==
* 1/4 C soy sauce
* 2 T prepared horseradish
* 2 t grated gingerroot
* 1 t sugar
* 1.5 t rice vinegar

=Instructions=
# Mix and refrigerate sauce
# Heat a pan over medium-high heat with the oil. Add mushrooms, ginger, and garlic and stir until mushrooms begin to soften.  
# Add green and purple cabbage, carrots, and green onions and stir-fry about 4 minutes or until crisp-tender. 
# Add soy sauce, and stir to cool.
# Place about 1 T of cabbage mixture in the center of each wanton wrapper, brush edges with water, and fold to form a triangle.  Pinch the folded edges together.
# Fry wantons over medium heat with some oil, moving frequently to prevent them from sticking.
