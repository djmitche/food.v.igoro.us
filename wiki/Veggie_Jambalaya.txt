=Ingredients=
* 0.5 C olive oil
* 2 C yellow onions, small dice
* 1 C red onions, small dice
* 1 C celery, small dice
* 2 C eggplant, diced
* 1 C yellow squash, diced
* 1 C zucchini, diced
* 1 T minced garlic
* 2 T minced shallots
* 3 C chopped tomatoes
* 1/2 to 1 t cayenne pepper, to taste (optional)
* 2 t Creole seasoning, to taste
* 1/2 t dried thyme
* 3 bay leaves
* 4 C long grain rice
* 1 C tomato paste
* 8 C vegetable stock
* 1 C chopped green onions

=Instructions=
# Heat the oil in a large heavy pot over medium heat. 
# Add the onions, shallots, bell peppers and garlic and saute until tender, about 5 minutes. 
# Add the celery, eggplant, squash, and zucchini, and saute until they're tender, another 5 minutes or so. 
# Add the tomatoes. Season with salt, Creole seasoning and additional cayenne if desired. 
# Add the bay leave, then add the rice and stir for 2 to 3 minutes.
# If you're making this Creole-style, heat the tomato paste in a non-stick pan and stir, making sure it doesn't stick or burn, until the sugars in the paste begin to caramelize, and the paste begins to turn a deep mahogany color.  Deglaze with some of the stock, stir and combine thoroughly, then add the tomato paste to the rest of the stock and stir until well-blended.
# Add the vegetable stock/tomato mixture, stir and cover. Cook for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed. Do not stir the jambalaya while it's cooking. 
# Remove from heat and let stand for 2-3 minutes. Add the green onions and mix thoroughly.
