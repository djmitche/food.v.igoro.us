This one is based on [[:Category:Cookbook:Bread Bible (Rose)|Rose's]] ''Golden Semolina Torpedo'', but since I don't have the relevant torpedo mold, I baked it in my baguette mold.  I use ''Golden Temple'' Durum Atta, of which I bought a large bag on Devon street.

=Ingredients=
* Sponge
** 100g durum flour
** 1/2t yeast
** 197g warm water
* Dough
** 155g durum flour
** 1t salt
=Instructions=
# Proof the yeast in the mixer bowl; stir in the flour to make the sponge
# Sift the salt and remaining flour and cover the sponge, but do not mix it in.
# Allow the sponge mixture to sit for a while -- I waited 8h.
# Knead the dough together.  It may be necessary to add a bit of bread flour to get it to hold together.  You want a finished dough that's still a bit tender but not tacky.
# Rise until doubled.
# Fold down the dough and roll it into a baguette shape.  Note that this dough is not wet enough to use the baguette process of rolling up a slab to make a log.  You'll need to roll the log directly.  If that didn't make sense, don't worry about it.
# Rise about another hour -- until it's gained about 50% volume.  In my case, I rise the shaped baguettes on a silpat laid over the baguette mold.
# Slash and bake at 400 for 15-20 minutes, or until the loaves are golden brown.
=Notes=
Rose's baking instructions are specific to using the La Cloche; the above are a rough reconstruction of what I tried, which seemed to work well.
