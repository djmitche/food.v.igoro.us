This isn't very complex, but it's really good and kinda unusual.

=Ingredients=
* Pasta (any sort)
* Wasabi Mayonnaise (not just wasabi; this comes in a bottle and is white with green flecks)

=Instructions=
# Prepare pasta
# Squirt about 1.5T of mayo per serving, stir, and eat

This is also great with some veggieburger (or presumably burger) mixed in.
