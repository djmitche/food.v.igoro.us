=Ingredients=
*8 tomates verdes (tomatillos), husks and stems removed, and coarsely chopped 
* 2 chiles serranos, seeded, deveined, and coarsely chopped
* 1 small white onion, coarsely chopped 
* 2 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped 
* 8 cups not-too-strongly flavored vegetable stock 
* 1/4 cup lima juice (look first for limas, second choice would be key limes, third choice regular market limes) 
* 3 large ripe avocados, peeled, seeded, and cubed 
* More lima juice to taste (if you are able to find Limas or Key Limes this will be roughly 1/4 cup, with regular limes it will be less) 
* 1/2 cup loosely packed cilantro 
* 1/2 cup crema (or substitute creme fraiche or sour cream) 
* Salt and pepper to taste 
* Salsa Fresca (for garnish) 
* Crema for garnish (optional)

=Instructions=
Add the tomatillos, serranos, onion, and garlic to the vegetable stock in a large pot. Bring to a boil and immediately reduce to a simmer. Cook over moderate heat for 20 minutes or until tomatillos are tender and losing their form.

Puree the vegetable/stock mixture well with a blender (my hand-held blender works great here). You want to puree it really well. Push through a strainer into a bowl (optional) to remove tomatillo seeds and skins and allow to cool on the counter. Stir in 1/4 cup of the lima juice and place in the refrigerator. Chill well, at least a couple hours or overnight.

When the soup base is completely chilled, puree the avocado thoroughly with a blender along with the cilantro and a couple splashes of the lima juice. Stir into the chilled soup base. Taste to see if you want to add more lima juice - you should be able to taste and smell the lima/lime flavor, but it certainly shouldn't be mouth-puckering. Whisk in 1/2 cup crema. Salt and pepper to taste then return to the refrigerator until ready to serve.

Pour soup into bowls, add a swirl of crema, a spoonful of salsa, and a sprinkling of tortilla strips to serve.
