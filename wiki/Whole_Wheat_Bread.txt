This recipe makes a whole wheat loaf that comes out just like you'd expect -- the texture is a bit coarse and the flavor is wheaty, with some sweetness.  While it began its life in Gelles' 1000 Vegetarian Recipes, I've modified it (using advice from Alton Brown) to use a sponge.

=Ingredients=
* Sponge
** 260g warm water
** 1/2t sugar
** 2.5t yeast
** 160g whole wheat flour
** 80g all-purpose flour
* Dough
** 160g whole wheat flour
** 80g all-purpose flour
** 2t salt
** 4T honey
** 2T vegetable oil
=Instructions=
# Proof the yeast with the water in the bowl of the stand mixer.
# Add the rest of the sponge ingredients and mix with a fork.
# Sift together the dry dough ingredients and pour them over the sponge, but do not combine.
# Allow the sponge to develop for some number of hours.  I waited about 8 hours.  It may bubble up through the dry mixture -- this is fine.
# Add the honey and vegetable oil and begin kneading the dough on #2.
# As the dough pulls together, raise the speed to #4 and knead until the dough is firm and only barely tacky.
# Rise until doubled -- 1-2h.
# Fold down and shape the dough into a loaf.  Rise about 30 minutes.
# Bake at 350 for about 45m or until the loaf is browned.  Rotate midway through the baking.
