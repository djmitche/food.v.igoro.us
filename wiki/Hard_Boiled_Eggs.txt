These are my favorite snack.  They're nature's little pre-packaged food items!

This is a recipe in development, as far as timing goes.

=Ingredients=
Eggs (duhhh)

=Instructions=
Cover eggs with water, bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and simmer for 13 minutes.  Remove eggs from water and allow to air-cool.

=Notes=
I use Phil's cage-free eggs for hard-boiled eggs.  When I'm frying eggs, it doesn't much matter, but there is a noticeable taste benefit to high-quality eggs when you're hard-boiling them.

Some folks suggest dumping the hot eggs into cold water to arrest the cooking and loosen the shell.  I find that this tends to result in broken shells (either from the shock of the cold, or from the eggs hitting the bottom of the pan), and I've never felt the arresting to be useful.  In my little theory, the boiling process cooks the white more than the yolk; allowing the eggs to cool slowly allows the yolk to finish cooking while the white cools.
