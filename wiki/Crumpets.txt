This is another one from Rose Levy Berenbaum's Bread Bible.  It's easy and tasty.
=Ingredients=
* 156g all-purpose flour
* 20g dry milk
* 1 t yeast
* 0.5 t sugar
* 0.5 t salt
* 200g water (divided)
* 0.25 t baking soda

=Instructions=
# Mix all but the baking soda and about 2 teaspoons of water thoroughly until smooth (#5 on a Kitchenaid).
# Allow to rise until doubled (1h)
# Mix baking soda and remaining water until dissolved, and stir into the batter (it will deflate)
# Allow to rise again, about 30m
# Heat a skillet at ''low'', and fill crumpet rings about 2/3 of the way to the top.  These are thick and need to cook through, so the heat really does need to be low.
# Allow to crisp on bottom and dry on top (to a matte finish), then flip and pop out of the molds.

=Notes=

If you don't have crumpet molds, don't bother with this recipe.  If allowed to free-form, these come out more like savory pancakes than crumpets.  With the mold, they push up and get nice and thick.  In the process, all of the rising agents (baking soda, yeast, and steam) create some nice big bubbles that make the center delicious and tender.
