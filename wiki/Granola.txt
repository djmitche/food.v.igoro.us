=Ingredients=
* 3 cups rolled oats 
* 1 cup slivered almonds 
* 1 cup cashews 
* 3/4 cup shredded sweet coconut 
* 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons dark brown sugar 
* 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons maple syrup 
* 1/4 cup vegetable oil 
* 3/4 teaspoon salt 
* 1 cup raisins

=Instructions=
#Preheat oven to 250 degrees F. 
#In a large bowl, combine the oats, nuts, coconut, and brown sugar. 
#In a separate bowl, combine maple syrup, oil, and salt. Combine both mixtures and pour onto 2 sheet pans. Cook for 1 hour and 15 minutes, stirring every 15 minutes to achieve an even color. 
#Remove from oven and transfer into a large bowl. Add raisins and mix until evenly distributed.

=Alterations=
I always mix in all sorts of different dried fruits.  Note that the type of oats selected seems particularly key.
