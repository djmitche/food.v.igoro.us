I had something similar to this at STEPS, a friendly wine bar in Friday Harbor, WA.  The place is highly recommended.  Theirs was with lovage, which is a green with something of a celery/bok choi taste.  I imagine this would be fine with parsely or cilantro, or just about anything else you could put in there.
